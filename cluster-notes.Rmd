## First things first: cluster etiquette 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("cluster-partitions.png")
```
Cluster members find it extremely annoying when one person is taking *all* slots of a job partition, thus preventing other jobs submitted to that partition from running. As a good rule of thumb, please make sure that your job does not use more than 20% of the available slots on your partition. This percentage can be raised if the cluster is super free one day (ex: holidays) or if your jobs are extremely quick.
